            <h2>Creator Information</h2>
            <p>My name is <strong>Rajesh</strong>, and I am a government employee working under the 5th Pay Commission of the Meghalaya Government. I am currently pursuing a Master of Arts in Economics from IGNOU. This website is part of my work to create an easy-to-use interface for calculating Dearness Allowance Arrears (DA Arrear) and Transfer TA based on the salary structure of government employees.</p>

            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This web application was developed to help government employees quickly calculate their DA Arrear and Transfer TA benefits by inputting their basic pay, increment percentage, number of months, and other necessary information. The project was inspired by the 5th Pay Commission of Meghalaya, which governs the salary structure for government employees.</p>

            <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
            <p>The web application is built using basic web technologies such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML for the structure and content</li>
                <li>CSS for styling and responsiveness</li>
                <li>JavaScript for handling calculations and user interactions</li>
            </ul>
